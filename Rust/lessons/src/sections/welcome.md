# Welcome!

This is the companion website for Richard Feldman’s [Introduction to Rust](https://github.com/rtfeldman/rust-1.51-workshop) workshop.

You should start by cloning [the repository](https://github.com/rtfeldman/rust-1.51-workshop) and following the instructions in the README.

When you’re done with that, you can use the sidebar to follow along here if you like. Note that this website covers the same material as the slides linked in the repository’s README, so you won’t be missing anything if you follow along with the slides instead.

Have fun!
