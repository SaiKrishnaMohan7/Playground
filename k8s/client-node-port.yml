  type: NodePort
  # All the ports that need to be opened up on the target object
  ports:
    # port opens up the defined port so that if any other container wants to connect to our client-pod (component: web ??) it can do so via this port
  - port: 3050
    # port inside of the target pod that we want to open up traffic to (should match containerPort from Pod definition)
    targetPort: 3000
    # port accessed by browser to test out container running inside target pod (30000 - 32767); Randomly assigned if not defined; That's why not used in Prod ??

  # label-selector system (relationship) is used to link the container running in the pod to the NodePort that is going to handle the (forward the req) req to the pod
