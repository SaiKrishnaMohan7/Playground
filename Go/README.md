# Go for JavaScript Developers

Systems programming language

## JS vs Go

- Dynamically typed vs strict typing
- Built in Error handling vs Explicit error handling, errors are values (huh?) so you need to tackle what all can go wromg first and then get to the meat of it
- Single Threaded vs Multithreaded, concurrency
- Fluid opinions (yuck) vs Built in linters, tooling hard to write shit code
