# Experiments on building AI apps

This folder is for experiments to understand two thing:
- Building apps with AI as a platform (AI bubble, just like the web 1.0 days)
  - Agents
  - Agentic workflows and many other buzzwords
  - LangChain: A framework to build ai apps
    - Not that useful since the API by foundational model providers has improved (check!!)
      - True that they have improved, but for complex agents LangChain may still be useful
  - LangGraph
- Understanding how foundational models work
  - This will be following Deeplearning.ai
